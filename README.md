# Integrate_and_Fire_Neuron
Integrate and Fire Neuron Repository:

This repository simulates spike trains inspired by [Softky & Koch, 1993]. We delve into the intricacies of the integrate and fire neuron model, focusing particularly on its inter-spike intervals (ISI) distribution as illustrated by equation [9]. A comparative analysis with real neural data is also explored to understand the model's efficacy and real-world applicability.

Leaky Integrate and Fire Neuron Repository:

Building upon traditional neuron models, this repository introduces the Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neuron. Acknowledging the transient nature of depolarization, this model accounts for the gradual decay of membrane voltage perturbations towards the resting potential. The LIF neuron offers a more realistic representation, considering the inherent leakage of postsynaptic potentials.

These summaries provide a brief overview of what each repository covers while giving the reader a sense of the context and relevance of the work.
